# Mercado Bitcoin
Heavly inspired on https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/data-engineering-project-to-impress-hiring-managers/

This project pulls data from mercadoBitcoin's API every 5 minutes, stores it in a PostgresSQL database then presents the data as a Metabase Dashboard.
Everything is run throught Docker containers.
